							This is also a work in progress.
							Two of these buttons are essentially placeholders.
							 Right now the TRO Export is the only thing remotely working.<br />
							<br />
							Remember that the PDF generation here is all on the client's computer.
							 Nothing here (with the exception of the initial HTML, CSS and JS loading)
							  is using server processing power.<br />

					<strong>Update Feb 7, 2017</strong>: I am well aware that IE and Edge do not display the PDFs.
					 I think a work-around will be to have the PDFs downloaded straight
					  instead of displaying in a new window. This is a known limitation in jsPDF
					  and so far no workaround has been posted.
