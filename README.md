##Purpose
The purpose of these tools is to have a centralized, accessible set of tools for 'mech creation and eventually force building.

The tools are powered by HTML, Foundation 6 and AngularJS. All data and logic are then compiled and handled by grunt via npm.

1. Get Succession Wars BattleMech creator working
2. Add Clans
3. ???

##Eventual Goals
1. Add BP force builder for common 'mechs for CBT. Records sheets are out of the question.  
2. Add Force Builder for Alpha Strike
