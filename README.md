# BattleTech Tools
## Purpose
The purpose of these tools is to have a centralized, accessible set of tools for 'mech creation and eventually force building.

## Development
### Technology
This application is an React Typescript PWA (Progressive Web Application) which allows a user to create a BattleMech (and evenutually more!) from any device with access to a modern web browser.

The tools are powered by HTML, Boosttrap 4 and React. All data and logic are then compiled and handled by npm.

There are no server moving parts for the application itself, and I'm going to do my best to keep it that way.
