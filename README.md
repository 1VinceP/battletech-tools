# BattleTech Tools
## Purpose
The purpose of these tools is to have a centralized, accessible set of tools for 'mech creation and eventually force building.

## Development
### Technology
This application is an React Typescript PWA (Progressive Web Application) which allows a user to create a BattleMech (and evenutually more!) from any device with access to a modern web browser.

The tools are powered by HTML, Boosttrap 4 and React. All data and logic are then compiled and handled by npm.

There are no server moving parts for the application itself, and I'm going to do my best to keep it that way.

### Eventual Goals
1. Add Battle Point force builder for common 'mechs for CBT. Records sheets are out of the question.
2. Add Force Builder for Alpha Strike
    * This would require access to the MUL data
3. Printable PDFs for A.S.
    * This should still all be done in the client's browser
