                      <p>I might be working on Google Account data syncing this afternoon, although Google still gives me the heebie-jeebies. First, however, I want to finish the internal <Link to="equipment-editor">Equipment Editor</Link> so I can get the rest of the Clan and Inner Sphere weapons ready for the BattleMech creator.</p>

                      <p><strong>2022 Feb 18</strong> - Since there's still a pretty big gap in Alpha Strike Force creation and BattleMech creation on mobile devices, I've decided to reopen this app again. The official App is great, albeit slow, and doesn't do much for Alpha Strike folks.</p>
